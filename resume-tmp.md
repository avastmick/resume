Experience
Author
August 2016 - Present
Architect at New Zealand Defence Force
November 2014 - June 2016 (1 year 7 months)
Architect and technology lead for Secret Enhancement Programme and Information Environment. This
 programme completely overhauls the NZDF's military operational ICT capability and will provide the
 technology foundations to ensure that fully participate in the information-driven warfare of today and do
 so in a highly secure manner. The solution I have designed is bleeding-edge and innovatory; it completely
 transforms the way that ICT is to be delivered within the organisation.
A fully automated outcome to meet flexible military operational needs of the New Zealand Defence Force.
 The solution includes a datacenter backend and hosting for a variety of applications, through to a user
 desktop.

Security of the solution was, of course, vital, and compliance to both local and international security
 standards was required.
The solution was delivered using Ancible, Vagrant, Packer onto a VMWare virtualized environment. The
 code base was secured and managed using GitHub Enterprise.
Technical Lead and Solution Architect at Datacom Systems (Wellington) Ltd
February 2008 - June 2016 (8 years 4 months)
Reporting at a senior GM level within the software division (S&I) of Datacom Systems Wellington I have
 had a wide ranging role that included:
- Technical leadership on projects including design of technical solution, implementation, and mentoring;
- Technical pre-sales, I would provide the technical inputs into the sales initiatives, in particular RFP / RFT
 responses where Datacom would seek to provide software services;
- On-site consultancy, either as a technical expert particularly in the web technologies and enterprise
 integration domains, or a wider architectural adviser who providing inputs into organisations technical
 delivery and quality processes.
Within the Datacom software division, S&I, there is a loosely coupled technical architecture team of four,
 each working on different accounts. Measurement is either through sales, either through bid-work or on-site
 opportunities, or a blend of utilisation and chargeable rate value.
During my time at Datacom I have always fully met and largely greatly surpassed the targets given to me.
Technology Lead at Bank of New Zealand
June 2013 - November 2013 (5 months)
Technology Lead for the NextGen Programme - Information Transformation
Technology Lead for RealMe at Kiwibank
January 2012 - June 2013 (1 year 5 months)
RealMe is New Zealand's Personal Information sharing platform. It allows individuals to digitally share
 information about themselves in real-time directly from authoritative data sources.
This means that the information individuals provide can be treated with a high degree of trust, mitigating the
 need for further back-office and manual verification steps. In simple terms RealMe will provide a means
 for organisations to automate and streamline their relationships with individuals while increasing trust and
 lowering risk.
Furthermore, individuals will for the first time have control over the verification of their personal
 information, seeing where, why and when they provided any personal information to organisations. They
 would know that through RealMe they would reducing the need for covert collation of information about
 them without their consent.

RealMe builds upon DIA's core igovt infrastructure to deliver a potentially market changing proposition: a
 viable means for individuals to share their personal information across the NZ economy. The solution created
 was an identity attribute broker that allowed seamless interchange of data from disparate sources. At the
 time it was highly innovative and approached the problem from a different angle to the approaches taken
 previously.
I led the solution development team across all parties and put in place the required technology, delivery
 processes and governance to deliver to market RealMe. The solution has to have met the very highest
 requirements of information security and privacy protection, as well as fulfilling the policies of the
 underpinning legislation.
I also led the product development team to develop the product roadmap for RealMe and help shape what the
 product will become over the next couple of years and beyond, including how RealMe will become a viable
 information sharing platform.
The technology for the solution is based on Open Source technologies used in a novel context.

IBM Practice Manager at Datacom
May 2011 - December 2011 (7 months)
This role was a short-term formal initiative internal to Datacom that leveraged my knowledge and
 understanding of the IBM technical solution stack, where I developed the roadmap and processes for
 Datacom to become an IBM Premier Business Partner within 3 months.
- I consolidated the skills base and initiated a training and certification programme to support the Datacom
 IBM software practice;
- I worked closely with IBM to ensure alignment on Datacom joint ventures at customers such as NZ
 Customs, ACC, Wellington City Council and Telecom.
Consulting Architect at Techspace Consulting Limited
November 2010 - May 2011 (6 months)
Enterprise Architect for the MSD/IR/DIA ServiceLink project business case development.
As part of the business case development team I built a set of architecture models that would support the short
 term goals of ServiceLink as well as the wider strategic goals of both government service transformation
 and ICT direction. The development of architecture models included the necessary requirement analysis,
 formalisation of architectural principles, a logical structural model and projected cost model that feed into the
 typical needs of complex architectures.

The architectural foundations laid here went on to inform a number of cross-NZ Government transformation
 or joint-agency initiatives.
Technical Consultant at ANZ
May 2008 - November 2010 (2 years 6 months)
I worked at ANZ providing technical consultancy across a number of key projects, including:
- International Payment Services (IPS): as lead payments architect I designed an innovative business servicebased
architecture using WebSphere Process Server with a Spring framework front-end. The solution was
 tailored for delivering international and high value payments to multiple channels.
There was a heavy emphasis on stakeholder management and communication to convey the benefits of the
 solution.
The implementation of IPS has been a success and seen a viable means of providing business function to
 multiple channels across the organisation.
- Common Systems: I led the architecture stream for the initial business case development to evaluate the
 means of core banking system consolidation for the then two banks (ANZ and National Bank) onto the same
 core banking product, Systematics. This work helped lay the architecture, technology and business analysis
 foundations for the later implementation under the NZS programme (2011-2012).
- Oscar: A retrospective architectural and technical review of an internally developed CRM tool in order to
 manage quality improvements through alignment to the new “Solutions Pack” I had developed I evaluated
 the current technical implementation including delivery process review and general code quality practices. I
 tabled recommendations for improvement and roadmap.
- ADLO was at the time ANZ’s sole business banking online platform. As architect, I introduced to ANZ
 a new Solution Architecture process and methodology, including a new artefacts “pack” that would cover
 all the required documentation for solution development, including a lightweight means of governance gate
 management. This was to raise the internal quality processes and introduce a more agile and robust software
 delivery.
Technical Lead and Solution Architecture at ANZ Bonus Bonds
March 2009 - May 2010 (1 year 2 months)
I designed the architecture and led the 12 person technical team for the re-platforming of the 20 year old
 CICS/COBOL Bonus Bonds registry system. and delivering a new channel infrastructure, including a new
 online channel "My Bonus Bonds", a new front office teller channel and back office administration system.
A strong focus, as always, was on the security of the system and the integrity of the data migration effort.
 This solution offered ANZ provided a systems upgrade that led to significant cost savings and reduction in
 operational cost as well as a modern web experience for the expansion of the Bonus Bonds product online for
 the first time.

A number of solution constraints were in place, within these the technology was a JEE application using
 the Seam framework with a SQL Server 2008 database deployed to a Sun Glassfish application server on
 Windows Server 2008.
I determined the technical stack as well as designing and configuring the delivery suite the used Hudson,
 Subversion, Jira and Sparxx EA tools.
I was hands on and built the identity management, authentication and authorization modules as well as
 conducted code reviews and ensured quality measures were adhered to.
Technical Consultant at Salmon Ltd
January 2006 - January 2008 (2 years)
Clients -

Technical Lead at Ondemand
January 2004 - December 2005 (1 year 11 months)
Formed and led the team that would produce deliver content for the first true Video On Demand (VOD)
 service in Europe. Included deciding the technology stack and development approach.
I was brought in initially as the software architect and later acted as the head of development. After initial
 evaluation I determined that given the truly novel nature of the job in hand no third party could deliver a
 solution that would not require wholesale customization or remodelling of their offering. This potential of
 providing complete IPR ownership to OnDemand persuaded the company owners that the best course was
Page 6
 in-house development based entirely on Open Source software. All knowledge was retained in-house with
 no on-going license cost, and a profitable sideline allowed the company to re-sell the solution to other VOD
 content providers across Europe.
The software is now used across Europe and the US and is a market leader for asset management and
 lifecycle management for VOD.
Development Manager / Technical Lead at Yoomedia
October 2002 - December 2003 (1 year 2 months)
Managed the product delivery team, including software development, graphic design and testing. Delivered
 into market a number of novel interactive cross-channel products including games, web applications, social
 sites and chat-based services to web, TV and early mobile channels.
Overhauled the company’s software delivery infrastructure. I rationalized the disparate technologies (Java,
 PHP, ASP, Visual Basic, DCOM) into a single Java/J2EE based solution stack. This:
- Lowered cost;
- Enabled simpler recruitment;
- Improved resource management;
- Reduced project time to market.
I designed the back-end components relying on free-ware/open source libraries. Implementing a crosschannel
MVC design pattern as content delivery system for dynamic content in a Digital TV client. We were
 early adopters of agile methodologies we used iterative processes to deliver products in an immature market.
The platform produced was pretty novel at that time and was a precursor to the now commonplace
 multichannel platforms. Whereas now these would be providing content to mobile and web channels via
 micro services, we did this to esoteric platforms such as Liberate (JavaScript), OpenTV (C) or web (HTML
 and JavaScript).
