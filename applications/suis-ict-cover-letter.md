I would like you to consider me for the teaching role for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at Shanghai United International School (SUIS), Pu Dong. Please find my current resume attached.  

I have worked in ICT for nearly twenty years. I started my trade as a software developer but rapidly moved into the design of complex systems.  During this time, I have designed and built many world class solutions:

- I designed and led the technical team that delivered the content management solution for the world's first true video on demand system produced in 2005; something that now everyone is familiar with through services such as Netflix and Hulu;
- I designed and led the team to implement the ANZ Bank International Payment Services, a high-value payments system that enables cross-border, inter-bank settlement across Australia, New Zealand and the globe, delivered in 2010. Billions of dollars of payments move through this solution daily;
- I designed and led the team to implement the New Zealand Electronic Identity solution, RealMe, delivered in 2013. That allows NZ citizens to transact digitally in a highly secure manner without divulging their identity to online businesses;
- Finally, I designed and led the team that delivered the New Zealand Defence Forces military operational ICT environment that was delivered last year, 2016. 

As part of my role across the years, I have managed large teams, as much as over fifty people. I have mentored many other individuals and led training courses on many aspects of technology. I am highly competent in all areas of ICT.

Since July last year, I have taken a sabbatical from the intense pressure and long hours my roles have brought over the years. While my career has been rewarding, both financially and professionally, there has been a detrimental cost to my family life â€“ I could often be away working for long periods, often abroad. The intention was to spend more time with my family. This year has allowed me to review my career and accept that family life is of paramount importance to me. 

In the last year, I have also written my first novel, Consensus, that will be published online on April 30th this year. Writing a book has been a rewarding experience, and I have learnt an enormous amount about the process and myself.

I foresee that I would be a valued member of your team at SUIS Pu Dong and would bring considerable experience, not only in ICT but also commercial and business acumen to any role I would be offered. 

I am excited by the opportunity and of finding a practical means of transitioning into a role as an educator over the coming years.
