# Resume Template

Uses the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) project as a basis (rough fork). Will merge in this into a proper fork at some point.

Then allows simple Markdown to create the content for both a resume and cover letter.

Just edit the ``resume.md`` and ``cover-letter.md`` files to create a pretty and flexible CV and cover letter.

Put a viable profile photo into the images directory and name it ``profile.jpg``.
