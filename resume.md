# Education

**University of York** (UK) 

*M.Sc. Information Processing*, 1998 - 99

- \color{gray}*Thesis: Virtual Camera Positioning in Graphical Worlds*. The problem domain was to create an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm using real-time 3D geometric / NLR analysis that would allow an optimal virtual camera position to be realized when viewing targets in a dynamic graphical world. The calculations would have overriding rule sets preventing non-natural viewing positions, yet avoiding target occlusion.

**RealMe at Kiwibank**

*Technology Lead*, January 2012 - June 2013

-   \color{gray}*RealMe* is New Zealand's Digital Identity and Personal Information sharing platform. It allows individuals to digitally share information about themselves in real-time directly from authoritative data sources.
-   \color{gray}This means that the information individuals provide can be treated with a high degree of trust, mitigating the need for further back-office and manual verification steps. In simple terms RealMe will provide a means for organisations to automate and streamline their relationships with individuals while increasing trust and lowering risk.
-   \color{gray}Individuals will for the first time have control over the verification of their personal information, seeing where, why and when they provided any personal information to organisations. They would know that through RealMe they would reducing the need for covert collation of information about them without their consent.
-   \color{gray}RealMe builds upon DIA's core igovt infrastructure to deliver a potentially market changing proposition: a viable means for individuals to share their personal information across the NZ economy. The solution created was an identity attribute broker that allowed seamless interchange of data from disparate sources. At the time it was highly innovative and approached the problem from a different angle to the approaches taken previously.
-   \color{gray}I led the solution development team across all parties and put in place the required technology, delivery processes and governance to deliver to market RealMe. 
-   \color{gray}The solution has to have met the very highest requirements of information security and privacy protection, as well as fulfilling the policies of the underpinning legislation.
-   \color{gray}I also led the product development team to develop the product roadmap for RealMe and help shape what the product will become over the next couple of years and beyond, including how RealMe will become a viable information sharing platform.
-   \color{gray}The technology for the solution is based on Open Source technologies used in a novel context.

-   \color{gray}The architectural foundations laid here went on to inform a number of cross-NZ Government transformation or joint-agency initiatives.

**ANZ Bank**

*Technical Consultant*, May 2008 - November 2010

- \color{gray}I provided technical consultancy to ANZ across a number of key projects.
- \color{gray}**International Payment Services (IPS)**: as lead payments architect I designed an innovative business service-based architecture using WebSphere Process Server (WPS) with a Spring framework front-end. The solution was tailored for delivering international and high value payments to multiple channels.
- \color{gray}There was a heavy emphasis on stakeholder management and communication to convey the benefits of the solution.
- \color{gray}The implementation of IPS has been a success and seen a viable means of providing business function to multiple channels across the organisation.
- \color{gray}*Common Systems*: I led the architecture stream for the initial business case development to evaluate the means of core banking system consolidation for the then two banks (ANZ and National Bank) onto the same core banking product, Systematics. This work helped lay the architecture, technology and business analysis foundations for the later implementation under the NZS programme (2011-2012).
- \color{gray}*Oscar*: A retrospective architectural and technical review of an internally developed CRM tool in order to manage quality improvements through alignment to the new “Solutions Pack” I had developed I evaluated the current technical implementation including delivery process review and general code quality practices. I tabled recommendations for improvement and roadmap.
- \color{gray}*ADLO* was at the time ANZ’s sole business banking online platform. As architect, I introduced to ANZ a new Solution Architecture process and methodology, including a new artefacts “pack” that would cover all the required documentation for solution development, including a lightweight means of governance gate management.

-   \color{gray}This solution offered ANZ provided a systems upgrade that led to significant cost savings and reduction in operational cost as well as a modern web experience for the expansion of the Bonus Bonds product online for the first time.
-   \color{gray}A number of solution constraints were in place, within these the technology was a JEE application using the Seam framework with a SQL Server 2008 database deployed to a Sun Glassfish application server on Windows Server 2008.
-   \color{gray}I determined the technical stack as well as designing and configuring the delivery suite the used Hudson, Subversion, Jira and Sparxx EA tools.

**Ondemand (Vubiquity)**

*Technical Lead*, January 2004 - December 2005

-   \color{gray}Formed and led the team that would produce deliver content for the first true Video On Demand (VOD) service in Europe. Included deciding the technology stack and development approach.
-   \color{gray}I was brought in initially as the software architect and later acted as the head of development. After initial evaluation I determined that given the truly novel nature of the job in hand no third party could deliver a solution that would not require wholesale customization or remodelling of their offering. 
-   \color{gray}This potential of providing complete IPR ownership to OnDemand persuaded the company owners that the best course was in-house development based entirely on Open Source software. All knowledge was retained in-house with no on-going license cost, and a profitable sideline allowed the company to re-sell the solution to other VOD content providers across Europe.
-   \color{gray}The software is now used across Europe and the US and is a market leader for asset management and lifecycle management for VOD.

**Yoomedia**

*Development Manager / Technical Lead*, October 2002 - December 2003

-   \color{gray}Managed the product delivery team, including software development, graphic design and testing. Delivered into market a number of novel interactive cross-channel products including games, web applications, social sites and chat-based services to web, TV and early mobile channels.
-   \color{gray}Overhauled the company’s software delivery infrastructure. I rationalized the disparate technologies (Java, PHP, ASP, Visual Basic, DCOM) into a single Java/J2EE based solution stack. This:
    +   \color{gray}Lowered cost;
    +   \color{gray}Enabled simpler recruitment;
    +   \color{gray}Improved resource management;
    +   \color{gray} project time to market.
-   \color{gray}I designed the back-end components relying on free-ware/open source libraries. Implementing a crosschannel MVC design pattern as content delivery system for dynamic content in a Digital TV client. We were early adopters of agile methodologies we used iterative processes to deliver products in an immature market.
-   \color{gray}The platform produced was pretty novel at that time and was a precursor to the now commonplace multichannel platforms. Whereas now these would be providing content to mobile and web channels via micro services, we did this to esoteric platforms such as Liberate (JavaScript), OpenTV (C) or web (HTML and JavaScript).
