Education
---------

*   **University of York** (UK)

    *M.Sc. Information Processing*, 1998 - 99

    - *Project: Virtual Camera Positioning in Graphical Worlds*. The problem domain was to create an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm using real-time 3D geometric / NLR analysis that would allow an optimal virtual camera position to be realized when viewing targets in a dynamic graphical world. The calculations would have overriding rule sets preventing non-natural viewing positions, yet avoiding target occlusion. The experimental work was written in C using the OpenGL graphics libraries. The work contributed to the work of my tutor Professor Patrick Olivier a world-renowned computer scientist in the fields of AI, virtual reality and avatar control.

*   **University of York** (UK)

    *B.A. (Hons.) Literature*, 1995 - 98

    - *Dissertation: Moby Dick*.

Work Experience
---------------

*   **New Zealand Defence Force** (Wellington, New Zealand)

    *Architect and technical lead*, November 2014 - June 2016

    -   Architect and technology lead for Secret Enhancement Programme and Information Environment. 
    -   This programme completely overhauls the NZDF's military operational ICT capability and will provide the technology foundations to ensure that fully participate in the information-driven warfare of today and do so in a highly secure manner. The solution I have designed is bleeding-edge and innovatory; it completely transforms the way that ICT is to be delivered within the organisation. 
    -   A fully automated outcome to meet flexible military operational needs of the New Zealand Defence Force.
    -    The solution includes a datacenter backend and hosting for a variety of applications, through to a user desktop.
    -    Security of the solution was, of course, vital, and compliance to both local and international security standards was required.
    -    The solution was delivered using Ancible, Vagrant, Packer onto a VMWare virtualized environment. The code base was secured and managed using GitHub Enterprise.

*   **\LaTeX\ + pdflatex**

    *Senior Resumé Maker*, 2008 - 2010

    -   Edited verbose \LaTeX\ documents in a text editor
    -   Mixed content and presentation to achieve pixel-perfection
    -   Installed and configured the unusual TeX setups required by the
        best-looking \LaTeX\ resumés
